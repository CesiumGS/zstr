** Header-only C++ IOStream Wrapper for ZLib

This library enables the use of C++ standard iostreams to access ZLib-compressed files.

Currently, only input access is implemented.

*** Input Auto-detection

For input access, the library seamlessly auto-detects whether the source stream is compressed or not. The following compressed streams are detected:

- GZip header, when stream starts with =1F 8B=.

- ZLib header, when stream starts with =78 01=, =78 9C=, and =78 DA=.

If none of these formats are detected, the library assumes the input is not compressed, and it produces a copy of the source stream.
